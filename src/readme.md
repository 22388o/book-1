# Introduction

hacspec is a specification language for crypto primitives, protocols, and more.
It is a subset of the [Rust] programming language.

This book gives an overview of
* [the hacspec language](./language)
* the different parts of the project
    * [the standard library](./std)
    * [examples](./examples)
* how to use hacspec to write [specifications] for standards and [verification]
* how to use hacspec to generate [test vectors]
* [work on hacspec itself](./developers/)

For a quick introduction you can also check out these [slides] from April 2021.
An in-depth [technical report] is also available.
